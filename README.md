# Dice-Roll-Forecaster
This Java-based Dice Predictor program allows the user to predict the outcome of a virtual dice roll, choosing a number between 0 and 6. The program checks the user's guess against a randomly generated number and provides immediate feedback. It also includes input validation to catch and handle incorrect or invalid entries, ensuring that only valid numeric guesses within the specified range are accepted.
